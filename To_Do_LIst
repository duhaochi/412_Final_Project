As of

    When there is no free space on the grid, segment fault. (Version 3 took care of it)
    When no argument is provided, the grid keep filling and program gives seg fault.
    When traveller are larger than the grid, 

    INT_MAX needs to be implemented.
    Version 2 need to Spawn travelers like Version3. Need to copy and compare


FINALLIZE VERSION 1 & 2 by end of the day.

    V1. QUESTION
        Does it ask any user input?
        HARDCODE FOR traveler
            i.e. width,
                 height,
                 moves_to_grow_segment

                 INT_MAX from <climit.h>

        Are we hardcoding for this single traveler or asking user input?

    QUESTION TO VERIFY
        MAX and MIN of grid
        row 12;
        col 12;
        once all the traveler exited,
            When do we do?
        
    ASSUMTION
        * program expect user to provide numeric string type.
        * number of threads cannot exceed the free amount grid (has to consider walls and partitions)




REPORT FINDING
    V2 Vs V3 
        no walls, no partitions generated given the exact occupants in V2 will not run because there is no lock

    V5
        2D Vector vs 2D array pointer
