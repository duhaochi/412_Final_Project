Starting Approach
Version 1.
Step 1: 
    Disable walls & partitions
    build 1 traveler by hand (list of segments)
Step 2:
    Then set numTravelers = 1 in code and use the random generator 
    Re-enable walls & partitions
    Determine list of possible moves for the traveler (print out)
Step 3:
    Disable wall and partitions again 
    Return to hard-code traveler
    Apply one move. One step only.

Step 4:
    Create traveler thread function.

Step 5:
    Loop while (list of possible moves not empty and exit not reached)
        select one move
		apply move
		get list of possible moves

Version 1 finished.
